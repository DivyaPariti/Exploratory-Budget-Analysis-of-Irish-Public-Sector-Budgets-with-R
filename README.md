# Comprehensive Analysis and Package Development for Ireland's Annual Budget Data


### Project Description:

This project involved completing a comprehensive final assignment with three main components: Analysis, R Package, and Functions/Programming. The assignment was completed using Quarto for documentation, ensuring clear presentation of code and results.

### Analysis:
  - Selected a dataset from Ireland's Open Data Portal, focusing on Table F - Annual Budget 2021, which contained detailed expenditure and income data.
  - Utilized various R programming techniques to conduct data analysis, including data manipulation, graphical visualization, and statistical summaries.
  - Employed popular R packages such as `dplyr` for data manipulation and `ggplot2` for visualization, ensuring clear and insightful presentation of results. 📊

### R Package:
  - Explored an existing R package not covered in the course, demonstrating its functionality through Quarto.
  - Clearly summarized the purpose of the selected package and showcased key functions using appropriate datasets.
  - Ensured proper documentation and presentation of code and output to meet assessment criteria. 📦

### Functions/Programming:
  - Developed custom R functions to provide tailored statistical analysis based on the dataset.
  - Documented the code with comments and provided working examples, incorporating S3 or S4 classes for output and appropriate print, summary, and plot methods.
  - Utilized datasets different from those used in previous parts to showcase versatility and proficiency in R programming. 💻
